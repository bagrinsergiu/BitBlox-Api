Getting Started
===============

----------------------------

Creating an API Key
===================
	Access to the API is available to everyone with a Noun Project account (including users with Playground accounts). Once you have logged in, visit the `app management page <http://thenounproject.com/developers/apps/>`_ to generate a new API key or manage existing keys. It is important that you treat this key as if it were a secret password. With an API key and secret, anyone can access endpoints from your account.

|
|

Authentication
==============
	The API is secured with OAuth 1.0a. You must use your client key and secret to sign requests when accessing the API. There are many `established libraries <http://oauth.net/code/>`_ that will take care of authenticating calls for you. There is no need to provide an access token as our API endpoints do not yet support granting access to a users private data.

	For more examples, please view our `sample code`_.

.. note::
* Nonce must be a minimum of 8 characters in length.

|
|

Making Requests
===============
	After authenticating, you can make requests. To make a request you simply need to point to ``http://api.thenounproject.com``. Itâ€™s really that simple!

	For reference, here is a list of our `public API endpoints <documentation.html>`_, `API Explorer <http://api.thenounproject.com/explorer>`_, and `sample code`_.

|
|

Supported File Formats and HTTP Responses
=========================================
	Every request will return a JSON response or an error response.


	**Examples:**

	- ``200 Success`` - returns data as JSON in the response body.
	- ``404 Not Found`` - may return extra error description in response body.
	- ``401 Unauthorized`` - may return extra error description in response body.

|
|

Pricing
=======
	We have plans of all sizes, and can customize plans to meet your needs. Please visit the `developers page <http://thenounproject.com/developers/>`_ for more information on our API pricing.

|

Unacceptable Uses
=================
	The Noun Project API is designed to empower developers with a visual language. Using the Noun Project API inappropriately will result in the review and removal of your API keys.

	**This includes but is not limited to:**

		- Distributing icons.
		- Reselling content.
		- Exploiting The Noun Project users or content.
		- Replicating The Noun Project.

|
|

Sample Code
===========

	**Python:**

	.. code-block:: python

		import requests
		from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1

		auth = OAuth1("your-api-key", "your-api-secret")
		endpoint = "http://api.thenounproject.com/icon/1"

		response = requests.get(endpoint, auth=auth)
		print response.content

	|

	**Ruby:**

	.. code-block:: ruby

		require "oauth"

		consumer = OAuth::Consumer.new("your-api-key", "your-api-secret")
		access_token = OAuth::AccessToken.new consumer 
		endpoint = "http://api.thenounproject.com/icon/1"

		response = access_token.get(endpoint)
		puts response.body
