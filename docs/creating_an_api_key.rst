Creating an API Key
==============

Access to the API is available to everyone with a Noun Project account (including users with Playground accounts). Once you have logged in, visit the app management page to generate a new API key or manage existing keys. It is important that you treat this key as if it were a secret password. With an API key and secret, anyone can access endpoints from your account.
