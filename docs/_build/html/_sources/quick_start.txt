About Remote Editor
===================
Text About Remote Editor...

Shopify's API implements JSON to manipulate each API resource in isolation, providing a RESTful interface. All API usage happens through Shopify apps created by either store owners for their own shops, or by Shopify Partners for use by store owners.

Any Shopify app that you create will use the Shopify API to access another shop's data and automate almost any action from their shop admin dashboard. When a shop installs your app, all they're really doing is giving your app permission to access their shop's data through the API.
