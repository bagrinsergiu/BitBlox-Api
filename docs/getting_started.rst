Getting Started

Creating an API Key
===================
	Access to the API is available to everyone with a BitBlox Developer account. Once you have logged in, visit the `app management page <http://testblox.info/applications>`_ to generate a new API key or manage existing keys. It is important that you treat this key as if it were a secret password. With an API key and secret, anyone can access endpoints from your account.

|
|

Authentication
==============
	The API is secured with OAuth 2. You must use your client key and secret to sign requests when accessing the API. There are many `established libraries <http://oauth.net/2/>`_ that will take care of authenticating calls for you. There is no need to provide an access token as our API endpoints do not yet support granting access to a users private data.

	| POST http://testblox.info/oauth/v2/token?
	| client_id=CLIENT_ID&
	| client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET&
	| grant_type=password&
	| username=USERNAME&
	| password=PASSWORD

	For more examples, please view our `sample code`_.


|
|

Making Requests
===============
	After authenticating, you can make requests. To make a request you simply need to point to ``http://testblox.com/api/``. Itâ€™s really that simple!

	For reference, here is a list of our `API Explorer <http://docs.testblox.info/doc/api>`_, and `sample code`_.

|
|

Supported File Formats and HTTP Responses
=========================================
	Every request will return a JSON response or an error response.


	**Examples:**

	- ``200 Success`` - Returned when all ok
	- ``201 Created`` - Returned when the object is created
	- ``400 Bad Request`` - Returned when an error has occurred while object creation
	- ``404 Not found`` - Returned when unable to find object
	- ``401 Unauthorized`` - Unauthorized access
	- ``429 Too many requests`` - Return when a client hits the rate limit (limit=7200, period=3600)
