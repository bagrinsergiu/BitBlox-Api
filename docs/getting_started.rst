Api Credentials
==============

Access to the API is available to everyone with a Noun Project account (including users with Playground accounts). Once you have logged in, visit the app management page to generate a new API key or manage existing keys. It is important that you treat this key as if it were a secret password. With an API key and secret, anyone can access endpoints from your account.


Authentication
-----------------


Your app cannot read BitBlox data without authenticating first. It must get permission from a user before gaining access to any of the resources in the REST API. This guide will walk you through the authorization process (described in greater detail by the `OAuth 2.0 specification <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749>`_).

API Credential Rotation
-----------------

Access to the API is available to everyone with a BitBlox Developer account. Once you have logged in, visit the `remote editor management page <http://www.bitblox.me/developer/editors>`_ to manage keys. It is important that you treat this key as if it were a secret password. With an API key and secret, anyone can access endpoints from your account.

Step 1: Request access token
-----------------

For creating access token: ``POST http://api.bitblox.me/oauth/token`` with the following parameters:

	- ``client_id (required)``: The API key for your app
	- ``client_secret (required)``: The Secret Key for your app
	- ``grant_type (required)``: Represents the flow needed for the Client to obtain Access Token
	- ``email (required)``: Client email.
	- ``password (required)``: Client password.

.. 	note::
	The access token is temporary, and can only be used for one hour after it has been generated.

Step 2: Example Implementations
-----------------

	**PHP**

	.. code-block:: php

		<?php

		  define('GRANT_TYPE_PASSWORD', 'password');

		  $client_id     = "{CLIENT_ID}";
		  $client_secret = "{CLIENT_SECRET}";
		  $email         = "{CLIENT_EMAIL}";
		  $password      = "{CLIENT_PASSWORD}";

		  $data = [
		    'client_id'     => $client_id,
		    'client_secret' => $client_secret,
		    'grant_type'    => GRANT_TYPE_PASSWORD,
		    'email'         => $email,
		    'password'      => $password
		  ];

		  $url = 'http://api.bitblox.me/oauth/token';

		  $curl_handler = curl_init();

		  curl_setopt($curl_handler, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
		  curl_setopt($curl_handler, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
		  curl_setopt($curl_handler, CURLOPT_POST, true);
		  curl_setopt($curl_handler, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);

		  $response = curl_exec($curl_handler);
		  $info     = curl_getinfo($curl_handler);

		  curl_close($curl_handler);

		  $response = json_decode($response);

		  $access_token  = "";
		  $refresh_token = "";

		  if ($response && $info['http_code'] == 200) {
		     $access_token  = $response->access_token;
		     $refresh_token = $response->refresh_token;
		  }

		?>

|
|

Step 3: Request new access tokens
-----------------

For each access token stored by your application, refresh it by requesting an access token using your new shared secret and the refresh token:
``POST http://api.bitblox.me/oauth/token``
with the following parameters:

	- ``client_id (required)``: The API key for your app
	- ``client_secret (required)``: The new Shared Secret for your app
	- ``grant_type (required)``: Represents the flow needed for the Client to obtain Access Token
	- ``refresh_token (required)``: The refresh token you created from your app’s page in the Partners dashboard

.. 	note::
	The refresh token is temporary, and can only be used for one hour after it has been generated.

|
|

Step 4: Example Implementations
-----------------

	**PHP**

	.. code-block:: php

		<?php

		  define('GRANT_TYPE_REFRESH_TOKEN', 'refresh_token');

		  $client_id     = "{CLIENT_ID}";
		  $client_secret = "{CLIENT_SECRET}";
		  $refresh_token = "{REFRESH_TOKEN}";

		  $data = [
		    'client_id'     => $client_id,
		    'client_secret' => $client_secret,
		    'grant_type'    => GRANT_TYPE_REFRESH_TOKEN,
		    'refresh_token' => $refresh_token
		  ];

		  $url = 'http://api.bitblox.me/oauth/token';

		  $curl_handler = curl_init();

		  curl_setopt($curl_handler, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
		  curl_setopt($curl_handler, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
		  curl_setopt($curl_handler, CURLOPT_POST, true);
		  curl_setopt($curl_handler, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);

		  $response = curl_exec($curl_handler);
		  $info     = curl_getinfo($curl_handler);

		  curl_close($curl_handler);

		  $response = json_decode($response);

		  $access_token  = "";
		  $refresh_token = "";

		  if ($response && $info['http_code'] == 200) {
		     $access_token  = $response->access_token;
		     $refresh_token = $response->refresh_token;
		  }

		?>

When the Token Expires
-----------------

When the token expires, your next API call will fail with the following result:

	.. code-block:: json

		{
		  "error":"invalid_grant",
		  "error_description":"The access token provided has expired."
		}

You’ll need to either refresh your token or create a new one. Our OAuth tokens expire in 3600 seconds (an hour).
